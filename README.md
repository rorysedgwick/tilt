#### Why  

Many times during my short career as a web developer I have come across small nuggets of information that I have seen the potential value of remembering for a specific circumstance, and found I did not have an appropriate place to record and retain that information. Little tidbits of knowledge regarding a certain quirk of Javascript, a function of the DOM, an unusual CSS selector method or the syntax of a framework-specific method have been understood and subsequently lost under a sea of other information. Learning through repeated use is how to ingrain information of this type properly into my head but many of these things only crop up in a project once in a blue moon. For this reason I decided to collate these assorted facts and findings that would otherwise be lost in the ether into a singe location.
