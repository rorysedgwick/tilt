### Why  

Many times during my short career as a web developer I have come across small nuggets of information that I have seen the potential value of remembering for a specific circumstance, and found I did not have an appropriate place to record and retain that information. Little tidbits of knowledge regarding a certain quirk of Javascript, a function of the DOM, an unusual CSS selector method, the syntax of a framework-specific method etc. have been understood and subsequently lost under a sea of other information. Learning through repeated use is how to ingrain information of this type properly into my head but many of these things only crop up in once in a blue moon.  

For this reason I decided to collate these assorted facts and findings into a single location, and by doing so hopefully help myself to remember them. This repository could also then become a reference index for helpful information. It will however be written in a very disorganised, rambling style so I would not recommend it for personal consumption by others.  


### What  

I intend to contribute to this repository every single day with a minimum of three things learned. The subject matter is completely open, only that it is somewhat related to web development and are things that I think would be useful to remember or are sufficiently interesting that I feelp deserve a place. If it is the end of the day and I do not have three things to contribute, it means I have not done enough research or reading that day and should do some before I got to bed.  

Each point will include a reference the location of the original information and possibly some further more in-depth resources, so I will be able to return to any of the facts and easily review the original source, as well as delve into the subject more deeply. These points may be completely new ideas or facts, things I have vaguely understood for a while that have suddenly crystallized in understanding in my head, or information that I have come across in the past and subsequently forgotten.  


### How  

Initially the files will be in a separate .md file for each day. This will lend itself to being easily converted into a blog or other publishing platform once this repository grows to a certain size that viewing it through GitHub becomes unwieldy and/or annoying.
