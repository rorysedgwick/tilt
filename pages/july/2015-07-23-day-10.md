#### NODE_ENV
* *This example is specific to Express but is good to bear in mind for other frameworks and situations*
* If you do not specify a value for `NODE_ENV` then Express will automatically assign it `development`, meaning view cache will be switched off, therefore views will be parsed and rendered for every request
  * Serious performance reduction when both of these factors are considered
* Ensure `NODE_ENV` is specified for whichever environment the application is running in, e.g. 'staging' or 'production'

#### Browser inconsistency
* Most browsers default `vertical-align` property to `baseline`
* Safari rendered elements with `display: table` or `display: sinline-block` differently for some reason
* Remember [this nightmare](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31580858/safari-implementing-displaynone-differently-to-other-browsers)

#### Bower
* Bower is a package manager that allows you to specify Javascript libraries to easily be downloaded and included in a project
* Example bower.json file:
```{
  "name": "newedenfaces",
  "dependencies": {
    "jquery": "^2.1.4",
    "bootstrap": "^3.3.5",
    "magnific-popup": "^1.0.0",
    "toastr": "^2.1.1"
  }
}```
* Run `bower install` from the command line
* Make sure to include `bower_components` in `.gitignore`
