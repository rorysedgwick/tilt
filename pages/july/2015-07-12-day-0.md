1. HTML5 offers a much richer array of functonality and syntactic diversity than is commonly used. For example, built in audio playing simply by using the ```<audio> ``` tag. ```<article> ``` and ```<section> ``` should also be used to some content instead of ```<div> ``` for everything. ```<article> ``` is for a selection of individual but related pieces of content, whereas ```<section> ``` is for grouping distinct pieces of content or functionality. A generic container that is simply for applying stying to a group of items should stil be a ```<div> ```. Also available for use:
* ```header ```
* ```nav ```
*```aside ```
