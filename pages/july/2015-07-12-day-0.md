1. **HTML5** offers a much richer array of functonality and syntactic diversity than is commonly used. For example, built in audio playing simply by using the ```<audio> ``` tag. ```<article> ``` and ```<section> ``` should also be used to some content instead of ```<div> ``` for everything. ```<article> ``` is for a selection of individual but related pieces of content, whereas ```<section> ``` is for grouping distinct pieces of content or functionality. A generic container that is simply for applying stying to a group of items should stil be a ```<div> ```. Also available for use:
* ```header ```
* ```nav ```
*```aside ```
 & many more

2. #### [Riot.js](https://muut.com/riotjs/)
* Define entry point tag in HTML file
* Mount component using riot.mount(<tag-name>, { [parameters that will become ```opts ```]})
* Define HTML component and follow with js logic, no ```<script> ``` tags required
* Riot includes e.preventDefault() by default when dealing with events
* Use methods of parent components by using ```this.parent.[method-name]()
* For compiling: ```npm run``` script, possible to automate using ```sass watch``` or other watch tool

3. #### Some ES6 bits
* ```add(e) {
  [function body]
}``` equivalent to
  ``` this.add = function(e)
  [function body]
}  
* ##### [Arrow functions, or =>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions)  
Omits need for word ```function ``` and often return statement. Single parameter written without parentheses, multiple inside them. To return an object literal, wrap object in parantheses in function body.
```this ``` value is bound to the ```this ``` value where function was defined, not called

* ##### [```let ``` statement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let) declares a variable within local block, statement or expression scope. [TDD Kata](http://tddbin.com/#?)
