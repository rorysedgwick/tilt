#### eslint
* A an alternative to jshint.
  * Offers more configurable rules that jshint
  * Each rule is a plugin
  * Supports ES6 syntax & functionality, turned off by default
  * Install globally and include an ```.eslint.rc ``` in project root
  * List of most rules found [here](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/master/.eslintrc)


#### Dealing with clients:
* Get all specifications and requirements for completion in writing prior to committing to a project. Regardless of who client is/if there is an existing friendly connection or how trivial the project seems
* Examine any wireframes/designs incredibly closely both with client and again without them. Identify any areas early on they might have missed/not completely covered and alert them
* If a client is being fiddly with designs, get them to figure out exactly what they want and then explicitly convey that, instead of going back and forward over tiny changes
* Ensure client is assuming work will be done over the specified time scale
