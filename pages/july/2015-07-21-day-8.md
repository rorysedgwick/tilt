#### Modernizr
* A feature detection library that allows conditional Javascript depending on what features are supported by client useragent
* Runs on page load and creates a Javascript object with results, as well as applying class to the ```html ``` object to hook CSS on
* Customizable download to only include the features you are using
* Script tag included in head of document
* Includes a shiv that allows HTML5 elements in IE
* Much better alternative than browser sniffing due to camouflage/misdirection employed by all user agents
* [Modernizr homepage](http://modernizr.com/)

#### es6 template strings
* Remember that expressions go inside ```${expr} ``` within the `backticks`
