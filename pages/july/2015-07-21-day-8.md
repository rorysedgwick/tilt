#### Modernizr
* A feature detection library that allows conditional Javascript depending on what features are supported by client useragent
* Runs on page load and creates a Javascript object with results, as well as applying class to the ```html ``` object to hook CSS on
* Customizable download to only include the features you are using
* Script tag included in head of document
* Includes a shiv that allows HTML5 elements in IE
* Much better alternative than browser sniffing due to camouflage/misdirection employed by all user agents
* [Modernizr homepage](http://modernizr.com/)

#### Flexbox
* Container properties:
  * `flex-direction`: defines axes along which items are placed
  * `flex-wrap`: allows items to wrap onto multilines or not
    * These can be set shorthand using `flex-flow: <flex-direction> || <flex-wrap>`
  * `justify-content`: defines alignment and free space along main axes
  * `align-items`: defines how items are placed on perpendicular axes
  * `align-content`: aligns lines of content (when there are multiple lines of items)
* Child properties:
  * `order`: integer value allows specifying of the order items appear in
  * `flex-grow`: allows items to grow if necessary, increasing by the specified proportion in relation to other elements (that have the default of 1)
  * `flex-shrink`: opposite of `flex-grow`
  * `flex-basis`: default element size before remaining space is distributed
  * `flex`: shorthand for above 3 attributes, recommended to set shorthand way by specifying first value for `flex-grow` and other values are computed
  * `align-self`: allows alignment set by `align-items` to be overwritten

#### es6 template strings
* Remember that expressions go inside ```${expr} ``` within the `backticks`
