#### Socket vs io
* ```io.emit ``` will broadcast to all connected sockets. Needed for some events but best practice not to overuse
* ```socket.emit ``` will broadcast to all listeners except the one it is being called on
* ```socket.join ``` can be used to join specific rooms

#### nodemon configuration
* Include a ```nodemon.json ``` file in project to define rules for nodemon
  * Watch certain directories/extensions and run npm scripts on save e.g. compiling Riot tags/bundling with browserify
