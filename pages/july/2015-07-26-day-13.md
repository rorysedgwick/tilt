#### Cloning nodes
* Technique often used when an HTML element is dragged and dropped
  * more efficient than detaching node, reattaching and then moving original node
  * also deals with possibility user drags the element to invalid target area; the original node is simply reshown and cloned node deleted
* Also used when calculations are needed to be done on a node that should be hidden from the user, e.g. removing an indeterminate length of characters from the middle of a string
  * node can be cloned and rendered on a lower view layer, contents edited and subsequently injected into viewable element
* Cloning is best employed when an action can involve a user manually moving nodes and the accompanying human error
* Browsers have the native method `cloneNode(bool) ` method, where `bool ` refers to making a `deepClone `, and is either
  * `true `, where all descendent nodes are also cloned
  * `false `, where just the target element is cloned
* Cloning does not attach the returned node to the DOM so this has to be done explicitly
* Cloning will copy all attributes and event listeners except those added using  `addEventListener ` or those assigned to element properties like `el.onClick = function(e) {...}`
* Be careful when copying nodes with IDs, as browsers will allow this happen will cause in errors in code expecting only one element to be returned from `document.getElementById() `, for example
* jQuery has a `clone ` method that will clone a node as well as all events bound by jQuery
  * will always deep clone, so be aware of scope of descentdent DOM tree and can be very expensive
  * arrays and objects associated with elements are also cloned, being passed by reference

* Cloning is useful when the original element should not be modified, e.g. creating a container element to hold a widget instead of making the existing element itself into a widget
  * the container element may be used for other purposes than that of the specific widget's, and the widget's functionality should not have the option to interfere with that of another element's

* Copying arrays and objects
  * `var arrCopy = myArray.slice(0)`
  * ```javascript
  var objCopy = {};
  for (var k in obj) {
    objCopy[k] = obj[k];
  } ```
