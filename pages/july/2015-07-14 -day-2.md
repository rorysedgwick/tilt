##### Redis data structures
* **Keys** are identifiers that are associated with one of the redis data types and are how you specifiy the target of various operations

* **Strings** are simplest data type
  * Useful for caching HTML fragments or pages
  * Max size of 512MB
  * ```SET ``` can fail if key exists, or vice versa
  * ```INCR ``` parses string as integer and increments. Operates atomically so two simultaneous command will still add 2. Also ```INCRBY ```, ```DECRBY ``` etc
  * Also operate on multiple keys using ```MSET ```, ```MGET ```
  * ```TYPE ``` indicates what data type is stored at ```key ```

* **Lists** are implemented as *linked lists*, meaning adding to either end is very quick but accessing elements by index is not as efficient as in an *array*. Rapid access to the middle of a data set is better done using a *sorted set*
  * ```LPUSH ``` & ```RPUSH ``` add (multiple) elements to beginning or end
  * ```LRANGE ``` returns values between given indices. Can be negative to start counting from the end
  * Capped lists are possible using ```LTRIM ``` to limit elements stored

* **Hashes** contain field-value pairs. Able to store any number of fields
  * ```HMSET ``` to set multiple fields, ```HMGET ``` returns array of values
  * Commands like ```HINCRBY ``` and more also available

* **Sets** are unordered collections of strings
  * Commands like ```SADD ```, ```SISMEMBER ```
  * ```SCARD ``` returns number of elements in the set

* **Sorted sets** are composed of unique, non-repeating string elements with associated floating point score and stored dependent on the score.
  * ```ZADD ``` take an integer before string to be entered
  * ```ZRANGE or ZREVRANGE 0 -1``` returns all elements, sorted by score
  * ```ZRANGEBYSCORE ```& ```ZREMRANGEBYSCORE ```to operate on ranges of elements


#### Pub/Sub
* Messaging pattern where *publishers* send messages without intended recipients, or *subscribers*
* Messages characterized by classes by publishers, and can be filtered by topic and published to logical channels
* Subscribers can filter messages they receive by content
* Pub/Sub systems allow publishers and subscribers to be loosely coupled and operate in ignorance of each other
* Easy scaling through parallel operation and message caching
* Disadvantages include tightly structured data that is difficult to change without changing all subscribers. Also basic pub/sub offers no guarantees of delivery


#### Observables
* A function that returns a function that returns an initial value
* This value can be reassigned, and is how state is managed in many JS front-end frameworks
