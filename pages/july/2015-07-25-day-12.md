#### HTML `z-index `
* z-axis is the third dimension of a web page after z & y axes
  * `z-index ` value represents the layer in this dimension in which it is rendered
  * default value is 0, negative value places the element underneath other layers (further away from the viewer) and a positive value places it in front of other elements (bringing it closer)
* `z-index ` will only affect an element that is positioned
* A positioned element is removed from the normal flow but remains in the same rendering layer
* Default stacking order, from the front, is `positioned ` elements, `floated ` elements, then nonpositioned elements
* A `stacking-context ` is created when an element is positioned and has a `z-index ` value other than `auto `, or when an element has an `opacity ` of less that 1
  * in simple web pages usually the only `stacking-context ` is created by root, `<html> `
  * a new `stacking-context ` is like a new page with its own rendering layers and self-contained normal flow
