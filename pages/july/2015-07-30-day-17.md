#### Server side inclues (ssi)
* Simple interpretive scripting language that allows inclusion of contents of single or multiple files into a page on a server
* WCRS use in the form:
  * `<!-- #*include virtual="../path/to/file.inc"* -->`
* Included file has to be of the extension `.shtml `, `.sthm ` or `stm `
  * unless server has been specifically configured to accept includes in other formats
* Only supports text
* Directives are placed in comments so if a user does not have SSI enabled they will not see the directive on the page without looking at source
* Other directive include
  * `exec ` to execute a program, script or shell command on the server
  * `echo ` to print the value of a http environment variable
  * `config ` allows configuration of the time, date, filesize and error message formats
  * `flastmod ` display time the file was last modified
  * `fsize ` displays a document's size
  * `printenv ` outputs a list of all variables and their values
* Also a number of control directives such as `if `, `elif `, `else `, `endif ` and `set `
  * can be used to control specific stylesheet importing
    * `if IE { blah blah }`
