#### HTMLElement.tabIndex
* Defines order in which HTML elements will be cycled through using the ```tab ``` key
* Disabled elements will not count as part of the list
* Not necessary for values to be perfectly sequential
* Can trigger ```hover ``` tooltips
* [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/tabIndex)

#### ESLint
* Either include an ```.eslintrc ``` file or ```eslintConfig ``` field in the ```package.json ```
* Configure the environments the ESLint should be run in, the global variables available, and specific linting rules
* All es6 language features are disabled by default
* Each rules enabled/disabled by value: [0] = off, [1] = warning, [2] = throw
* Use ```/*eslint-disable */``` blocks to allow code inbetween to be ignored by linter
* Add ```.eslintignore ``` file in root to define which folders/files to be ignored by linter
* Multiple ```eslintrc ``` allowed in eahc project; files will look for closest to detemine rules
* Some useful rules: {
  * "quotes": [2, "double"]
  * "no-unused-vars": [0]
  * "no-trailing-spaces": [0]

#### Socket.io
* Create a new instance of the io() server on client side
* ```socket.on("event-name") ``` allows front-end to listen to server emitted events
* ```var io = require("socket.io")``` and make sure it is listening to your server/app
* ```io.emit("event-name") ``` that triggers front-end functionality
