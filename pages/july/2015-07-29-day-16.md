#### [Qunit](http://qunitjs.com/)
* Simple testing library designed for unit testing
* Include the Qunit script and an iframe in the index.html, the test.js files in separate script files

#### Favicons
* Shortcut icons that appear in browser tab window, bookmark page etc.
* Include the image in project root, or put in your image folder and include this script in the HTML head:
  `<link rel="shortcut icon" href="/path/to/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon"/>`
* Unless suppressed this will automatically be requested by the browser


#### Safari inspector is a pain in the arse
