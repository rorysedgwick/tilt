#### Mouse events
* Best practice to
  * bind `mousemove ` on `mousedown ` to prevent unnecessary triggering of mouse events
  * unbind `mousemove ` on `mouseup ` to prevent unnecessary triggering of mouse events
  * bind the `mouseup ` event handler to the `<body> ` as the `mouseup ` event might be sent a different HTML element

#### Peanut stirfry
* Cut the carrots really thin and add to pan before any other veg
* It can always use more fresh chilli/chilli flakes/dried chillies/tabasco
