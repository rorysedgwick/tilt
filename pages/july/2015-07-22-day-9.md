#### Closures
* Function defined within another function that has access to the outer function's variables
* A closure is a special object that contains the function it was called inside and the local variables available when it was created
* Defines and associates an environment (data) with a function that operates on that data
* Allows management of private variables - define an anonymous function that returns methods to operate on the contained variables and that is the only way to access them
* Instantiating the private variable twice will create two separate instances that can be operated on independently
* Practically, closures can be used anywhere an object with a single method is used
* Use with care, as functions defined within functions can have impacts on memory consumption and processing speed

#### CSS ::pseudo-elements
* Uses double colon notation to distinguish from :pseudo-classes such as ```:hover, :active ``` etc
* Allows insertion of content before or after specified element using ```selector::before & selector::after``` respectively
* Using ```::selection ``` targets whatever is the focus of user input
  * Can only be used to change ```color ```, ```background ```, ```cursor ``` & ```outline ``` attributes
* Can also be used to target ```::first-line ```s or ```first-letter ```s
* [W3Schools page](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_pseudo_elements.asp)
* Experimental technology: ```::backdrop ``` refers to an invisible box rendered directly under every element that is in the top layer

#### Prototypes
* Defining a method on the prototype of a constructor will reduce number of times the method needs to be assigned, as opposed to defining when creating the constructor
  * Means method definitions do not need to occur at every object creation


#### File extensions
* Ending all test files in e.g. ```filename.test.js ``` allows easy specifiying of which files to include in test, lint, coverage, & other scripts as well as ```.editorconfig ``` or ```.jshintrc ``` rules

#### Array methods
* Number is a valid argument to pass into ```arr.map ``` to transform every element into a number
  * ```myArray.map(Number) ```
* Using arrow functions with array methods is simple: ```arr.map(ele => ele * 2)```
