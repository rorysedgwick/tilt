#### Oddbits
* **grep** refers to to a **g**lobal search using a **re**gular expression and **p**rinting the results

* **[Atomicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomicity_(database_systems))** in database systems means either the whole process occurs or none of it does. To an external observer the transaction either has not started or has been completed. A series of database operations occur, or none of them occur
  * forms part of the **[ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID)** suite of transaction properties, along with
    * **consistency** (database operations on alter the data in allowed ways),
    * **isolation** (how transaction integrity is visible to multiple users and systems), and
    * **durability** (the guarantee that transactions that have been committed are permanently retained, even following extreme cases such as a power outage)
