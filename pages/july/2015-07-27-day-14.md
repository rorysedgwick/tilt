#### Oddbits

* **[Atomicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomicity_(database_systems))** in database systems means either the whole process occurs or none of it does. To an external observer the transaction either has not started or has been completed. A series of database operations occur, or none of them occur
  * forms part of the **[ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID)** suite of transaction properties, along with
    * **consistency** (database operations only alter the data in allowed ways),
    * **isolation** (how transaction integrity is visible to multiple users and systems), and
    * **durability** (the guarantee that transactions that have been committed are permanently retained, even following extreme cases such as a power outage)

* **[delta encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_encoding)**, or delta differencing/compression , is a means of storing data in the form of differences, or deltas, in sequential data
  * it is a much more space efficient way of storing changes to large files as only revisions are re-saved instead of whole files. Used for some version control softwares such as Git
  * used by HTTP to respond to some requests with differences in a web page when client holds a cached copy of the page. Can be much more efficient that replying with an entirely new instance of the resource

* **[grep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep)** refers to to a **g**lobal search using a **re**gular expression and **p**rinting the results
