#### es6 imports
* Basic usage ```import name from module-name```
  * Can replace ```name ``` with ```{ member }``` or ```{ member as alias }``` or ```{ member1, member2 }```
* Also simply ```import module-name```
* Include ```export ``` before anything you want to export from module
* Static module structure means imports are determined at compile time and not when it is executed. Static checking means faster lookups of properties
* Allowed only at root level
* [Blog post explaining imports](http://www.2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html) in depth
