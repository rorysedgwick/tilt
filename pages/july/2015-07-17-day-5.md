#### Web components
* Attempted to solve the problem of how to encapsulate Javascript, HTML & CSS and making this extensible without impacting other DOM nodes
* Reusable custom HTML elements
* Intended to give developers a way of encapsulating, protecting and packaging the implementation sections of HTML
* HTML templates and partials to be writtine in ```template ``` tags
* HTML imports mean single interaction point for independent bundles to be loaded. Imported HTML require/include links will be read, meaning a whole application and its dependencies can be included
* Shadow DOM allows isolated portions of render tree to be protected from styling, access and modification
* Combining these means we can have custom elements with their own isolated DOM subtrees imported via single tag
* Web components often refers to the collection of new features that together allow developers to create reusable components in a standard fashion
* Underlying code for individual components will still be similar, but wrapped in a standardized, simplified, native interface with convenient methods for including its dependencies

#### CSS [attr & value] selectors
* Offers ability to variously [select elements using attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors)
  * ```[attr=value] ``` selects elements with ```attr ``` exactly matching ```value ```
  * ```[attr~=value] ``` selects elements where ```attr ``` list includes ```value ```
  * ```[attr^=value] ``` or ```[attr$=value] ``` selects elements where ```attr ``` is prefixed or sudffixed by ```value ```, respectively
  * ```[attr*=value] ``` selects elements where ```attr ``` contains at least one occurence of ```value ``` as a substring
  * Utilised for Stockport project local help table, targetting elements using ```th[scope="row"] {``` and ```td[data-title] {```

* The ```AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition)``` pattern allows async loading of modules to avoid problems with usability, performance and debugging

* Premature optimisation can be the source of many unnecessary bugs. Monitor performance as your API develops and make optmisation decisions on a case-by-case basis as issues arise
