#### Array methods: `splice ` vs `slice `
* `splice `: alters contents of passed array by removing elements and/or adding in new ones
* Will return an array containing the deleted elements
* Arguments are
  * `start ` value to begin removing from. Negative value begins that far from end of array
  * `deleteCount ` specifying how many elements to remove. Leave blank to clear to end of array
  * `itemN ` array of items to be added  

* `slice`: returns shallow copy of the portion of the array specified
* Arguments are
  * `begin ` zero-based index to begin copying. Negative value indicates offset from end of array
  * `end ` zero based value to extract up until, not inclusive. Leave blank to copy up until end of array
* If an object reference is copied from the original array, a change to the original object will be reflected by the elements in both arrays. Numbers and strings copied are not passed by reference so will not change

#### HTML flow & positioning
* Using pure css vs Javascript will be more efficient and less bug-prone
* Flow:
  * `position: fixed, relative` or `absolute ` classify they document as positioned and remove it from the normal flow
  * Positioning does not cascase do has to be specified in child elements
  * `offsetParent ` is an attribute applied to element that is positioned. It becomes a container element and any children are positioned relative to this container
  * the `offsetParent ` property will either be `null `,
