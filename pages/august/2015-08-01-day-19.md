## 8th light workshop

#### Testing
* Try to limit function and tests to 3 lines
  * 'runner' functions that simply call other functions are a good way to break up code
* Think of self-imposed constraints to change the way you are approaching a problem
* Don't be afraid to delete your code

#### [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction.html)
* Assertion library for Javascript
* Use `jasmine init` to create a spec file for current project
* Start with a `describe ` block to set up the suite of tests
* Tests are then instigated with the `it ` statement and a "should ...."
* Assertion line is formed of `expect([expr]).[jasmine assertion]([expr]); `
