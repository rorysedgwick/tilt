#### es6 features - safe integers
* Javascript stores all numbers as floating points and has only enough space to represent up to 53 bit signed integers
* Starting at 9007199254740992, which is 2 ^53, each Javascript integer represents two real integers and therefore these values are considered unsafe
* es6 introduces the `Number.isSafeInteger(num) ` method that returns a boolean depending on whether it is a safe integer or not
