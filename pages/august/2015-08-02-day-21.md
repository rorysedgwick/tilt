#### Photoshop
* A photoshop `.psd ` file is usually comprised of multiple layers that can be traversed vertically
  * allows easy distinction of content sections to separately apply effects, styling, transforms such as rotations etc
  * easy swapping of layers means files can be altered and re-created with focal parts changed e.g. localised screens at WCRS
* Rasterisation refers to the translation of a vector graphic image into a raster format (pixels or dots), for  example before displaying on a computer screen
