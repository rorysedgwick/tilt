#### es6 features - classes
* Syntactic sugar on top of prototypal inheritance pattern already found in Javascript
* Are technically functions, and can be thought of as constructor functions
* Provide a clearer syntax for creating objects and dealing with inheritance
* Class declarations are not hoisted, and calling one before defining it will throw a reference error
* Use of `extends ` allows declaration of subclass that inherits from an existing constructor
* The `static ` keyword defines a static method for a class, meaning it cannot be called once the class is instantiated and is called without instantiating the class
  * the method is associated to the class, not instantiated members of the class and so can only be called by using the class name
  * the static method is associated with the constructor function, and not the prototype object itself
  * the static method will not have access to any of the fields, methods or properties defined on an instance using `this `
  * A good example of this is `Date.parse() `, which is a static method of the `Date `constructor and is therefore called using the constructor itself and not as a method an instantiated date object
* Classes are block scoped
* Multiple methods defined inside a constrctor does not need to be comma separated (as opposed to object notation)
