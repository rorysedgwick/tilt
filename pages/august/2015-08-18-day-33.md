#### es6 [destructuring assignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment)
* Destructuring assignment is a new way of accessing values in arrays and objects that resembles the syntax for their construction
* If there are multiple values to be returned from a function, instead of having to create an array and populate it with the values, simply return the values inside array notation and they will be correctly inserted and returned
  * `function myFunc() { return [a, b, c]`
  * `var [x, y, z] = myFunc()` will assign the return values from the function into the variables inside the array
  * also possible to ignore values using a comma, `var [x, , y] = myFunc()` will store the first and third values returned from the function
* This also works outside functions, so instead of having to specify multiple variables specified by their index in an array, do the following: `var arr = ["first", "second", "third"]; var [a, b, c] = arr;`
* The need for temporary variables to hold values to be swapped is removed
  * `[a, b] = [b, a]`
* Extracting relevant info from a url or path is more concise as you do not need to define storing each section separately
  * `var [protocol, domain, countryCode, userName, repo, branch, blob, file] = gitHubURL.split("/");`
  * also works with regex matching of capture groups, or if the regex returns an array of matched sections

#### Testing for integers
* Need to find out if a number is an integer? Simple
  * `Number.isInteger(value);` 
* Part of es6
* `NaN ` and `infinite ` both return `false `
* String values of numbers also return `false `
