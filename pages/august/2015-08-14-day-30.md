#### es6: [Iterators & Generators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Iterators_and_Generators)
* An **iterator** is any object that can access items from a collection one at a time, and knows which position is it at in the collection.
* Javascript iterator objects have a `next() ` method that returns the value of the next property in the collection, and a `done ` value
  * `done ` refers to the iteration process of the whole object, i.e. its value is `true ` when the iteration is completed

* A **generator** is a factory function for producing iterators
* A generator must contain the `yield `expression and is defined using the syntax `function* myGenerator() { } `
* Generators only compute yielded values on demand, making them much more efficient when dealing with large iterables, including those with inifinite or indefinite length
* Essenially they are functions that can be exited and re-entered while maintaining their variable bindings

* Interesting info on iterators & generators from [Strongloop](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/introduction-to-es6-iterators/)
