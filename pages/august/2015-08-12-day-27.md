#### Removing elements from arrays
* Array methods such as map and filter do not work properly if elements are removed during function execution, as the indexing of remaining elements is affected.
* Two options using `for loops`:
  * Start at `array.length -1 ` and count down, splicing at `i, 1`
  * Start at 0 and count up, splicing at `i--, 1`
