#### more on [Generators](http://davidwalsh.name/es6-generators)
* Javascript generator function are *cooperative* processes, indicating it chooses when to allow an interruption to execution
  * this is specified by the `yield ` keyword
    * in contrast to a *preemptive* process, which refers to a process that can be interrupted by external code
  * the generator then has to be restarted externally, which allows passing of information back inside the function part-way through execution
* Instead of the function taking in parameters and returning a value at the end, the generator produces values on each `yield ` and has values passed back in on restart

#### single threaded application
* means only one command or function can be executing at any given time
* Javascript is single threaded
  * but there is a mechanism called Web Workers that can spin up another thread for a separate section of the code to run in parallel
  * the two threads can only communicate with each other through async events, so the event-loop still only executes things one at a time
