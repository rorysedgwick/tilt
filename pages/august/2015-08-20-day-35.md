* Maps are key values stores similar to Javascript objects
* However there are some key differences
  * Map keys can be of any type, whereas in objects they must be strings
  * Iterating over a map will return the values in insertion order, which is not guaranteed in objects
  * Maps automatically keep track of their size (`Map.length `)
* It is suggested to use maps over objects when all keys are same type and all values are same type
  * If there is independent logic within different elements use objects
* Get and set values on the map using `myMap.get(propName) ` and `myMap.set(propName) `
  * property names can be accessed using the actual key name or a variable holding that value,
