#### Flatten arrays
* Using `Array.prototype.concat.apply([], inputArray);`
* [Array.concat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat) returns a new array composed of the array it was called, on as well as any arrays that were passed as arguments

#### [Array.slice](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice)
* When using `array.slice() ` the values passed in the parentheses indicate where to start slicing from and for how many index places
  * supplying a negative number will start slicing from that many places from the end

#### RegEx variables
* It is possible to pass a variable into a regex to search for, but care is needed when dealing with escaped characters, as they will need to be double escaped from the string and the regex
* `var reg = new RegExp("\\b" + word + "\\b")` allows searching text for any supplied word, with a word boundary on either side
  * using `reg.test(text) ` will search the supplied text and return a boolean
  * use `str.search(reg) ` to return the index of any matches

#### the [`arguments `](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments) object
* All the arguments supplied to a function are stored in an array-like object which can be accessed using square-bracket notation and integer values
* Commonly transformed into an array using ` var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments) ` for easier manipulation
