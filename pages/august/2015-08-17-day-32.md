#### statement vs expression in Javascript
* A **statement** is a section of code that performs an action
  * simple examples are `for ` loops and `if ` statements
* An **expression** is a section of code that produces a value, and can be written wherever a value is expected
  * function calls, numeric operations and variables are examples
* Wherever Javascript allows a statement, an expression can be written instead
  * known as an *expression statement*
* When remembering the difference consider an `if ` statement vs a conditional operator used in an expression
