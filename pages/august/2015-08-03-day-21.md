#### Photoshop
# A photoshop `.psd ` file is usually comprised of multiple layers that can be traversed vertically
  * allows easy distinction of content sections to separately apply effects, styling, transforms such as rotations etc
  * easy swapping of layers means files can be altered and re-created with focal parts changed e.g. localised screens at WCRS
* Rasterisation refers to the translation of a vector graphic image into a raster format (pixels or dots), for  example before displaying on a computer screen
  * `.tiff ` (*tagged image file format*) files are commonly used to display raster graphics images
    * ability to store files in a lossless format means TIFF files can be good image archives as they will not lose quality with re-saving
    * also offers lossless data compression
    * a form of bitmap storage
