#### Photoshop scripting
* The Photoshop DOM is a *containment hierarchy*, meaning each object contained within the hierarchy is partially defined by the object that contains it

* Application
  * Documents collection
    * Document
    * Document
    * Document
      * ArtLayers collection
      * HistoryStates collection
      * Layers collection
      * Layersets collection
      * Channels collection
      
* Use `activeDocument ` to access the currently open document, or `documents[i] ` to select a document from an array of open ones
* Targeting objects contained within `app ` is implied so `app.documents[2] ` is equivalent to `documents[2] `, but including `app ` may improve clarity

* The *Application object* is the root of the Photoshop hierarchical model
* The *Document* object targets the document image and allows transformations such as canvas resizing, rotating etc
  * Also allows targeting of active layer
* An *Art Layer* within a Document allows editing of a specific part of an image. Images are typically composed of multiple layers, which are defined as a *Layer Set*
  * Image composition can be changed by reordering and editing *Art Layers*
  * Layer Sets can contain other Layer Sets recursively
* The *HistoryState* is an object that keeps a records of all changes made to the active document
* The *Document Info* class contains meta data about a particular document
The *Notifier* class allows you to tie scripts to events, such as creating a new document when Phototshop is opened

#### Javascript ~ operator
* This performs the algorith -(N+1) to the expression on its right hand side
* Using `~~ ` before an number is a quick way to reduce it to an integer e.g. `~~58.42 ` returns `58 `
* Will never return `NaN ` if it fails, simply `0 `
* Will behave differently to `Math.floor() ` when applied to negative numbers
* This is technically the [Bitwise NOT operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_Operators#Bitwise_NOT), which will return the inverse bit for each bit in that number
  * `~9 (base 10) = 11111111111111111111111111110110 (base 2)` because `9 (base 10) = 00000000000000000000000000001001`

#### The DOM (another definition)
* A Document Object Model is an Application Programming Interface that allows you to programmatically access various components of a document using a scripting language
