#### es6 features - tail call optimisation
* Must be in strict mode for optimisation to work
* A **recursive process** is a series of deferred operations with hidden information inside every recursive function call - this information is hidden in the *call stack* and kept track of by the *interpreter*
* A **recursive procedure** is the opposite, with each new function call containing all the information regarding the state of the operation
* If the last operation performed by a function is to return the invocation of another function, and that call does not need access to any of the current local variables, the es6 interpreter will clean and reuse the current stack frame
* Tail call optimisation will therefore only affect recursive procedures, and not recursive processes
* [An interesting explanation](http://benignbemine.github.io/2015/07/19/es6-tail-calls)
